        <ul>
            <li>The <i>estimated period</i> for delivery is <strong>{{ date("m/d/Y", strtotime($order->ced_start)) }} â€“ {{ date("m/d/Y", strtotime($order->ced_end)) }}</strong>. Normally you can expect your building to be delivered sometime within this period. If your building has special order items, including insulation, wiring and/or a metal roof, the delivery of your building may occur outside of the estimated delivery date.</li>
            <li>Manufacturing will determine the date of completion for your building, including the installation of any special order items such as insulation, wiring and/or metal roofs.</li>
            <li>Once the date of completion has been determined for your building, our dispatcher will call you to schedule a delivery. This will typically be at least 3 days prior to the delivery.</li>
            <li>If you have requested a specific delivery date and/or time when you placed your order, rest assured that we will do our best to accommodate your request. We cannot however guarantee that your requested delivery date and time will be available.</li>
            <li>Once your delivery date has been scheduled, our driver will contact you the day prior to the delivery to setup a 4 hour delivery window.</li>
            <li>Our driver will contact you again once your building is loaded for delivery or if the delivery window changes.</li>
